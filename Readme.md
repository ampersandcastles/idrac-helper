# idrac helper

Really this is a personal python script for myself. If you find it useful, great! If not, that's fine too. If you have a suggestion, I'm all ears. I can't promise I'll implement it, I'm pretty bad at coding. I'll try though, sounds like fun! Maybe...

Anyway, this script is designed to do a few things with my 720xd. It powers it on/off, changes the fan speed, and toggles the dynamic fan speed. 

## Options
```-h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p {on,off}, --power {on,off}
                        Power on or off the server
  -f [0-100], --fan [0-100]
                        Set fan speed percentage
  -d {on,off}, --dynamic {on,off}
                        Toggle dynamic fan control```
